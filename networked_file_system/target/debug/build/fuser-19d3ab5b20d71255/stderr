The system library `fuse3` required by crate `fuser` was not found.
The file `fuse3.pc` needs to be installed and the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable must contain its parent directory.
The PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable is not set.

HINT: if you have installed the library, try setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the directory containing `fuse3.pc`.
